# Power BI Dashboard: Life Expectancy Analysis

## 🧩 Business Problem
### “Why do some countries live longer than others?”

### Governments, public health organizations, and NGOs often struggle to identify the root causes behind low life expectancy in developing nations. Despite global efforts in healthcare funding and vaccination drives, there's often no clear visibility into:

#### - 📉 Where healthcare investments are failing
#### - 🧒 How malnutrition impacts young populations
#### - 💉 Whether vaccination programs are improving outcomes
#### - 💰 How economic strength influences health
#### - 📊 How education or lifestyle factors correlate with longevity

Stakeholders need a data-driven solution to uncover hidden patterns, track progress over time, and prioritize interventions.

## 💡 Solution Using Power BI Dashboard
### Your Life Expectancy Dashboard solves the problem by transforming raw WHO health data into actionable insights through:

### ✅ 1. KPIs for Instant Monitoring

#### - 🧠 Average life expectancy
#### - 💀 Mortality and infant death rates
#### - 💰 Health expenditure & GDP per capita
#### - 💉 Vaccination coverage
#### - 🎓 Education levels (Schooling)

These indicators highlight which areas are lagging and require attention.

### ✅ 2. Correlation and Trend Analysis

#### - 📈 Compare economic strength (GDP) vs health outcomes
#### - 🕵️ Track improvement in life expectancy by country/year
#### - ⚖️ Identify gaps between Developed vs Developing nations
#### - 📉 Measure effect of HIV/AIDS and malnutrition

This helps policy makers prioritize funding, track program success, and understand what drives longevity.

### ✅ 3. Visual Insights for Better Decisions

#### - 📊 Bar charts for country ranking
#### - 🌍 Maps for regional disparities
#### - 🧮 Scatter plots to reveal cause-effect relationships
#### - 🔁 Heatmaps to identify year-over-year changes
#### - 🧠 Smart Narratives for AI-driven takeaways

These allow non-technical users to easily explore the data and draw conclusions.

### 🏁 Summary
